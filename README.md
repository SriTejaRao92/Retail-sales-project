# Retail-sales-project
This repository contains the analysis and visualizations I have created in Tableau.

# Overview
This project involves creating an interactive dashboard using Tableau to analyze and visualize retail sales data. The dashboard provides insights into key metrics and trends, helping stakeholders make informed business decisions. The dataset includes detailed sales transactions from a fictional retail landscape, capturing various aspects of sales performance, customer behavior, and product categories.

# About Dataset

This synthetic dataset has been meticulously crafted to simulate a dynamic retail environment, providing an ideal playground for those eager to sharpen their data analysis skills through exploratory data analysis (EDA). With a focus on retail sales and customer characteristics, this dataset invites you to unravel intricate patterns, draw insights, and gain a deeper understanding of customer behavior.

# Dataset Overview:

It includes key details such as Transaction ID, Date, Customer ID, Gender, Age, Product Category, Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Amount. These attributes enable a multifaceted exploration of sales trends, demographic influences, and purchasing behaviors.
